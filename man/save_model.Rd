\title{Stores the results of the model to files}
\usage{
save_model(model, validated_options)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A model opbject returned by \code{estimate}}

\item{validated_options}{A list of validated model options returned from 
\code{\link{validate}}}
}
\description{
This function takes the model object and the list \code{save_opt} and stores
the specified outputs to files. The model object is stored to an .rds file, 
model summary created using \code{\link{summarize}} is stored to a .txt file
using \code{sink()}, and hessian and variance-covariance matrices are stored
as .csv files. Appropriate checks should be in place to avoid over-writing
existing files and to close open sink connections. However, it is on the user
to be careful with file names to avoid any chance of loosing data.
